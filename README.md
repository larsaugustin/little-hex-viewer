# Little Hex Viewer

This is an incredibly simple hex viewer, that runs in your browser. You can see a simple demo of this running [over at Glitch](https://hex-viewer.glitch.me).

## Setup

Just install and run!

```
npm install
npm start
```

You can now open a new instance of the hex editor by opening the URL printed after you started node.

## Usage

On the homepage, you can choose a file to look at. ***Warning:** The viewer doesn't split large files, meaning you shouldn't try to view incredibly large ones.*

## Bugs?

Open an issue!
